ROUTES: 
-> currently some routes use clientPromise in their route. js but this is not needed since
   the helper function in db.js indirectly uses a clientPromise thorugh the getDb.
   Therefore, need to refactor and make all routes consistent and SAME.

~ P.S clientPromise clientPromise holds that one connection promise, so you don’t reconnect to MongoDB every time you run a query.


Need to Understand:
-> Db.js client promise and helper function
